This project is the first assignment in Algorithms - programming module in second year Applied Computing course. 
Aims of the assignment were to:

- read in an image file
- count the number of objects in the image
- locate and highlight objects in the image
- provide full JUnit test coverage

The application is written in Java and Java Swing is used as GUI interface. Picture class from the following website 
is used to deal with images:

Luminance class is used to determine the intensity of light (luminance) of each analysedpixel. Luminance class
is available here:

http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.html

Two mentioned above classes are not tested nor is main class - ImageAnalyzer, as all of its method are private.

Full JUnit test coverage is provided for ComponentImage class. 

Instructions about how to run the app are available as Javadoc in ImageAnalyzer class.
